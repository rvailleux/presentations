# W3C - a Community-led Standardization Organization
- Any individual can participate to working groups
- Anyone can be a W3C member (membership fees apply :))
  - Browser Editors
  - End-users Solution providers
- Any member can propose for a new standard
- A standard will succeed only if it is elaborated collectively
- The working group leaders are making sure the consensus is going forward and reached before publication of a news standard.

# Yes but what is WebRTC?
- **P2P**: A protocol to set up a P2P connection across some peers over the Internet
- **Real-time**: A way of exchanging video and audio and data streams with low latency
- **Universal**: Implemented in most browsers (desktop and mobile) since 2013 (and any app that implements the W3C standard)
- **Secured**: Streams are sent through encrypted network.
- **For developers**: Javascript APIs and HTML DOM objects

## Where to start?
1. **Get a view on the architecture** (20min by Tashi): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ci91dfKCyc 
2. **Try plain WebRTC**: https://webrtc.org/ or https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API or https://web.dev/webrtc-basics/
3. **Find it too hard** and look for shortcuts: some video service platforms offers out-of-the-box WebRTC SDK to speed up and stabilise your app.
